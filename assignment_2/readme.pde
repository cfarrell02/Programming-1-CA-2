 Brief description of the animation achieved: A simple game where a character must traverse a "river" by hopping accross on logs.
 Each time the player reaches the top it resets the avatar back to the bottom and increases the score by 10. Each time the player 
 gets reset the logs speed up. If the player falls in the water, the game "fails"
 
 Known bugs/problems: n/a
 
 Any sources referred to during the development of the assignment (no need to reference lecture/lab materials):
